# 🧮 Simple Calculator App

A beginner-friendly calculator app built with Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—within an interactive loop. Users can continue calculations using the previous result or start a new calculation.

---

## 📌 Features

- Perform basic math operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Loop-based interaction for continuous calculations
- Console-clearing between sessions for a cleaner UI
- Functional and modular code structure
- ASCII art for visual appeal

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using functions and dictionaries for clean logic mapping
- Handling user input with loops and conditionals
- Structuring reusable code for clarity and simplicity
- Building a better command-line interface

## 🚀 Run This Script

1. Make sure Python is installed, then run the script:
2. python main.py
3. To see the ASCII art logo, ensure art.py is in the same directory.

What's the first number?: 5
Type a mathematical operator: +
What's the next number?: 9
5.0 + 9.0 = 14.0
Type "y" to continue calculating with 14.0, or type "n" to start a new calculation:
